# Shout To Remove Stress (Tarzan Mode)

A mod for Project Zomboid that lets your character reduce stress by shouting — either a regular shout or a special Tarzan-style yell (default key: <code>.</code>).

## Description

- **Regular shout**: reduces stress by 0.03 (configurable) for 20 in-game minutes
- **Tarzan yell**: hold the assigned key (<code>.</code> by default) for at least 2 seconds to perform a powerful stress-relieving (and zombie-attracting) scream — 0.1 for 30 minutes.
- All parameters (cooldowns, stress reduction values) are configurable via Sandbox Options.
- Supports both male and female shout sounds.

## Requirements

## Keybindings
